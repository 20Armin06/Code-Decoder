# Letter-Number Encoder/Decoder

This is a simple Python application that encodes and decodes text by mapping each letter to its position in the English alphabet.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

- Each letter is converted to its corresponding number:
  - `a` â†’ `1`
  - `b` â†’ `2`
  - ...
  - `z` â†’ `26`

- The encoded message is a series of numbers separated by spaces.

- The decoder reverses this process, turning numbers back into letters.
